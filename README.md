# USSPA

> **Unofficial community integration.** This project is based on a **reverseâ€‘engineered private API** of the USSPA iOS app. **Use at your own risk; no warranty** of any kind.

Home Assistant integration to monitor and control USSPA hot tubs via the cloud endpoint.

  - `light` â€” Light 1 (and Light 2, disabled by default until confirmed)
  - `switch` â€” Bubbles (Pump3), **Heat blocking** (Safe Mode)
  - `select` â€” Stream speed (Pump1): **off / low / high**
  - `number` â€” Temperature setpoint (text input, 0.5 Â°C step)
  - `button` â€” **Enable / Disable Heat Blocking**
- **Timestamps** are timezone-aware (UTC).
- Any **unknown keys** are created as disabled-by-default entities to avoid clutter.
- **Options Flow** to set polling interval (default **30 s**).
